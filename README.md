# Pediatric Respiratory Emergencies in San Diego - Data and Code Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the analysis of Pediatric Respiratory Emergencies in San Diego. Here, you will find the data and code used for our study. Below is a brief overview of the organization of this repository:

## Data

- **Drop_Respiratory_Visit.csv:** This file contains the records of respiratory visit numbers per year per zipcode.

- **Spatial_Join_SVI.dbf:** This database contains the results of the spatial join operation, which associates district-level CDC social vulnerability indices to zipcodes.

## Code

- **Figures_Tables.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook allows you to reproduce all the figures, tables, and statistics reported in our study.

## Figures and Tables

You can find the figures and tables generated from the analysis in the `/figures` folder.

We hope this repository will be valuable for those interested in our research on pediatric respiratory emergencies in San Diego. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
